<h1>Welcome to the j8583 Framework</h1>
<P>This framework provides ISO8583 messaging utilities for Java 5. Its objective is to simplify as much as possible the creation and parsing of ISO8583 messages.</P>
<P>The message format and protocol are somewhat complex and cumbersome. The definition is available <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CombinedQueryResult.CombinedQueryResult?queryString=8583">here</a> so we will not be getting into the protocol specification. This document and the framework are intended for people who are already familiar with this standard.</P>

<h2>Download</h2>
<P>You can <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=194767">download the framework here</a>.</P>
<P>It includes documentation and some examples using TCP sockets which is the typical means of communication using this protocol.</P>

<h2>Configuration and Use</h2>
<P>Configuring j8583 is very easy. You can create a XML configuration file and place it in a file inside the classpath. The default is j8583.xml in the classpath root. The configuration file can contain definitions for ISO headers, message templates and parsing guides. The DTD is located <a href="http://j8583.sourceforge.net/j8583.dtd">here</a> if you want to take a look at it or use it with a XML editor.</P>
<P>You use the ConfigParser to create a MessageFactory and configure it with a XML file. Once you have a MessageFactory you only need to specify whether you want it to set the date on newly created messages, and also set a TraceNumberGenerator to set the trace number for newly created messages.</p>
<P>You can learn how to use the XML configuration <a href="config.html">here</a>.</P>
